# [Your Name] - [Team name] Accomplishment Tracking

Each team member should have their own version of this document.

## Background

It's a great habit to record accomplishments and progress throughout your SDE
career. It's useful to reflect on what you've worked on in the past and comes in
handy during performance reviews and promotion cycles.

## Instructions

**Save a copy of this document in your “private” folder.**

Using the below template, keep track of what you’ve worked on each week during
the unit. 1-3 bullets under each section for each week should suffice. This
should only take 5 - 10 minutes of reflection each week.

As you track your work, think about how it relates to the SDE fundamental skills
laid out in the syllabus and how you are practicing them.

* Converts a design into code and delivers it using best practices
* Writes secure, testable, maintainable code
* Understands when to use (or not) a broad range of data structures and
  algorithms
* Creates unit tests that thoroughly test functionality
* Troubleshoots by debugging and reviewing errors, logfiles, and metrics
* Contributes to planning and design
* Escalates when projects hit roadblocks and risks

The important work samples don’t only include the things you authored, but
should include things like key CRs you reviewed that you are proud of as well!

_You will submit your completed Accomplishment Tracking Document to your
instructors by the end of the unit._

## Week 1

**Goals:** Create a design for Aether Ark - what we want our user to be able to do. 

**Activity:** Standup meetings with the team and creating our team charter. 

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned:** Being able to communicate clearly our ideas, and the importance of using diagramming tools. 

## Week 2

**Goals:** Creating The Activities and dependency Injection. 

**Activity:** Designing activities, writing custom exceptions, and using Dagger dependency Injection. 

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned:** When you have a solid plan, coding out the solution is quite effortless. Vice versa, not having a plan, or having a bad plan, takes a lot of extra work. 

## Week 3

**Goals:** Connecting with Lambda Functions and API Gateway. 

**Activity:** Documenting our API and fixing bugs in our code. 

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned:** Tests are difficult at first, but ultimately save time and make debugging easier. Single Responsibility Principle matters. 

## Week 4

**Goals:** Learning front end tech stack

**Activity:** Creating a front end with CSS and HTML, and doing basic CRUD with javascript

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**:

**Things learned:** Approaching a new technology(like javascript) with an attitude of curiosity and fun makes the learning process much better.
