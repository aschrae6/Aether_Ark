# Aether Ark Reflection


*Please answer at least one question from each section below. Answers here will
likely be inspiration for the “lessons learned” section of your project
presentation at the end of the unit.*

## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway?
* A: Our overall implemented design stayed very similar to our original plan. However, as we encountered 
issues, certain classes and activities were refactored to better suit the applications purpose and 
resolve integration issues. (ex: CelestialBody)

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
* A: We handled the ambiguity of defining our own project by making the most of the early brainstorming sessions 
and putting ourselves in the shoes of the user and what we would want to do with the application when it was fully functional. 
We used the Trello board and daily stand-ups to create and assign concrete tasks, which was very effective.

## Scrum

* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
* A: We overestimated the amount of work we could complete during the sprints. 
Certain activities ended up being more difficult than initially expected, and some functionality ended up being out of scope.
If we were to do it over, we would create a full stack/working frontend earlier on in the project.
Also, if there was something we are not familiar with, we knew it would take more time, 
but it almost always took even more time than we planned.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
* A: If we were to do this over again, we might limit backend logic and spend more time learning/exploring the front end,
because it ended up being a lot of fun! 
We would also make designing and writing tests a priority even if we initially don’t want to.
